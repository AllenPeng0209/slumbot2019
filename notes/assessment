How do I want to assess the multiplayer systems I build?

Traditional RGBR impossible.

Run CFR with n-1 positions frozen?

Head-to-head.

Will need play_agents and translation to do many of the head-to-head evaluations that I
am interested in.  For example, a reentrant system with more bet sizes compared to
a non-reentrant system with fewer bet sizes.
