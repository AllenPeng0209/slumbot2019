Solve small mb1b1 game
Solve larger mb2b2tr game with more bets and bet sizes on turn and river
Use progressive endgame solving to build large system from small base
See if resolved system is close in performance to large system.

Resolving all nodes on a street, or all nodes on a street and all following streets.
Still using same betting abstraction for the base and the resolve.

Was I getting better results before?  That's odd.  Maybe only with the unsafe method?
I assume old results below were with the unsafe method.  Is there any way the unsafe
method could have a bug, but not the combined method?

More nesting didn't make things much worse.

  Better than base too.
