Seems like aggressive reentrancy doesn't hurt much, at least as measured by head-to-head.

Boosting seems to lead to more reasonable strategies at nodes that are rarely visited by
normal CFR.

Unsafe resolved system outperforms combined head-to-head.  Both when measuring against
each other, and when measuring each against the base.  But the combined system has lower
exploitability.  It might be that the unsafe system has "overfit" to the base abstraction.
Still holds when comparing head-to-head to a system solved to a low exploitability with no
abstraction.

Boosting doesn't seem to improve resolved results (heads-up).
