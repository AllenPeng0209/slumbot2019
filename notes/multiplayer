How should I calculate RGBR for multiplayer?

Seems like I implemented this in Slumbot 2017.  Do I believe the results?  Run it again,
I guess.

I'm thinking I want a 1 vs. n-1 best-response.  Holding n-1 of our strategies fixed,
compute the best response for the opponent in the remaining position.  Do that for each
position.

Is it possible to take a sampling-based approach to best-response calculation?

I thought any sampling-based approach leads to "clairvoyance" for the responder.

What does Trevor propose?  Is he sampling from the target player's strategy?

Can I adapt my approximate RGBR technique?  Play according to the target strategy profile
for streets 0...n-1.  Starting from street n allow responder to modify his strategy.
Can sample board cards for streets 0...n.
