I've run into lots of problems with head_to_head.  Indicates current code is too error prone.
How can I rectify?

Have set num hole card pairs incorrectly.
Have used wrong board index (global or local)
The different sorting of hole card pairs on the river has caused problems.

What if we always sort hands by strength?  Come up with a hand strength measure for six
cards.  When indexing buckets, also use this ordering of hands.  Will always need a
CanonicalCards object.

TCFR needs fast lookup of buckets.

Buckets class could take a boolean depending on whether you wanted to use the sorted hand
indexing or the unsorted hand indexing.  That's still somewhat error prone.

Buckets class could take cards as an argument.

I also have two ways to calculate offset for RMProbs().  Messy and error prone, no?

Error prone that we have to get right hands from street_hands_ in head_to_head.
