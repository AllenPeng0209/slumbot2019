Want to give the target player the most important bet sizes.

One way to decide is to build an asymmetric system and a symmetric system and see
if the symmetric system beats the asymmetric system by a lot or a little.

Another way is to look at the P0/P1 values during training of a symmetric system
and the P0/P1 values during training of the asymmetric system of interest.  They
shouldn't be too different.

Or even just look at the P0/P1 values during the training of the asymmetric system.
What P1 can get when P1 is the target player should be as close as possible to what
P1 can get when P0 is the target player.

head_to_head now giving results for asymmetric, but I'm not sure if I believe them or not.
Really big win for symmetric mb1b2 against asymmetric asyma.  OTOH, much smaller win
for symmetric mb1b1aai against asymb.  Which I expect because all-ins should be less
useful.

Could try asymmetric system that doesn't give extra options to the opponent?  That's what
testasym did.  That still doesn't prove things are fully working.  There could be a problem
aligning succs, for example.  The test with mb1b1aai and asymb was better and gave a much
smaller advantage to the symmetric player.  Is that conclusive?  Might be nice to have
a made up bet size that is in the middle of valid bet sizes but which always leads to a
terrible outcome for the bettor.  In that case the symmetric and asymmetric players should
perform identically.
