Want to give the target player the most important bet sizes.

One way to decide is to build an asymmetric system and a symmetric system and see
if the symmetric system beats the asymmetric system by a lot or a little.

Another way is to look at the P0/P1 values during training of a symmetric system
and the P0/P1 values during training of the asymmetric system of interest.  They
shouldn't be too different.

Or even just look at the P0/P1 values during the training of the asymmetric system.
What P1 can get when P1 is the target player should be as close as possible to what
P1 can get when P0 is the target player.
