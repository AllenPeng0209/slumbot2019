Fix nondeterm play

It's a mess that we need to pass around root_bd_st/root_bd and if we get it wrong there are subtle
errors.

Is there a discrepancy with suited vs. unsuited hands in TCFR?  Can get very different strategies.

Implement sampled_br?  Or just use CFR with n-1 players strategies' fixed?

To copy from macduff:
Slumbot website code and data
Settings from .bashrc (e.g., AWS_SECRET_KEY)

Build a system with lots of reentrancy.  Then cluster distinct histories that were pooled by the
distributions that reach them.  Then retrain with each cluster becoming a distinct node.  Could
also factor in how often the histories are reached.

Create a new github repository.  Call it slumbot2019.  Check everything in there.
