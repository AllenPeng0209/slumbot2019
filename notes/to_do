Switch to mb2b2ai as testbed.  May need more actions for tcfr to outperform ecfr.  May need
more actions for boosting to help resolving.  May need more actions for combined resolved systems
to outperform unsafe resolved systems.

Build a card abstraction that is bigger than nhs and smaller than nxhs3.  Maybe should use
abstraction on the turn.

Resolving all endgames for holdem5/mb2b2ai will take more than 24 hours.  Also ran out of
inodes.

Experiment with MCTS as a tool for approximate best-response calculations.

Experiment with multiplayer and reentrancy.  Evaluate with head-to-head?  Can we use h5;
i.e., a 20 card deck?  6 hole cards, 5 board cards, 9 unused cards.  I guess so.

Support multiplayer in endgame solving.  Need to support multiplayer betting trees in
CreateSubtree() in solve_all_subgames.

Build a h5ms3f1p6 system with a non-reentrant tree.  Currently using hs3 buckets, but should
probably do something better for the river, and bucket the turn as well.

Finish converting unsigned ints to ints everywhere.

Get rid of that ugliness where the opp probs is inside VCFRState but not owned by it.
shared_ptr?  Also street_buckets.  Shouldn't need to create outside.

Get rid of cast to float of cbr values in dynamic_cbr.cpp.

Should I boost CVs instead of boosting regrets?  Can I boost only at leaf nodes?  I don't want
to boost at several nonterminals on the way to a river terminal node, do I?  Wouldn't that lead
to too much boosting?

Boosting at terminal nodes is possibly excessive.  I only want to force players to reach every
nonterminal.  But maybe it wouldn't hurt too much to do so.

For deeply embedded nodes, I am worried about the boosting becoming very attenuated.  Only
1/1000 hands may go down the preflop succ.  Then maybe only 1/1000 down a flop succ.  By the
logic of Targeted CFR, can we do iterations that are forced to go down the boosted succs?

Use newer FileReader and FileWriter classes in slumbot2019

Can we clean up templated code.  Or abandon that approach even?  OppChoice() is a bit of a
mess.  Try to clean that up if nothing else.

Incorporate more modern C++:
1) Replace new with unique_ptr everywhere possible
2) Look into std::array and other container we might want to use
3) Use auto wherever possible; e.g., for iterators
4) Use C++ multithreading primitives
5) Look into new kind of iteration
6) Look into constructors that assign initial values
7) Get rid of typedefs
8) CFRValues should not take pointer to betting tree
9) Replace NULL with nullptr everywhere possible

Fix determ play

It's a mess that we need to pass around root_bd_st/root_bd and if we get it wrong there are subtle
errors.

Is there a discrepancy with suited vs. unsuited hands in TCFR?  Can get very different strategies.
