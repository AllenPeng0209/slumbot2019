Base: Exploitability: 2.86 mbb/g
  Matches slumbot2017
unsafe: Exploitability: 3.83 mbb/g
  Basically matches slumbot2017 (3.84)
  Matches our "redo" below.

  Raw CVs:      Exploitability: 3.05 mbb/g
    Matches slumbot2017
  Zero-sum CVs: Exploitability: 2.95 mbb/g
    Matches slumbot2017
combined
  Zero-sum CVs: Exploitability: 2.92 mbb/g
    Doesn't match slumbot2017 (2.69)
    Does match our redo below.

ms1f3
mb1b1
Base: Exploitability: 1.43 mbb/g
  Matches slumbot2017
unsafe: Exploitability: 1.17 mbb/g
  A little worse than slumbot2017 (1.12)
  Maybe that was hard warmup in the resolve
cfrd
  Raw CVs:      Exploitability: 1.66 mbb/g
  Zero-sum CVs: Exploitability: 1.61 mbb/g
  slumbot2017 had 1.37, but I don't know if that was for raw or zero-sum
combined
  Zero-sum CVs: Exploitability: 1.61 mbb/g
    Doesn't match slumbot2017

  Matches everything except old slumbot2017 results.  Hmm.

Hypothesis: I've tweaked combined endgame solving in slumbot2017 since those old results were
obtained.  Results on small games have gotten worse as a consequence.  It's possible that
results on bigger games have gotten better.
