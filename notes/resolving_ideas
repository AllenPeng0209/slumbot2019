Thinking up variants of resolving methods.

Can we estimate T values for CFR-D, instead of trying to compute exactly?  If we estimate
them with machine learning should get estimates that are more robust; i.e., no large errors.
Alternatively or in addition, could compute T-values for buckets.

Since these T values are estimates, why not revisit maxmargin?

In CFR-D we get a value that is the value obtained for the hand minus the T-value and
we try to minimize that.  What if we wrapped that in a sigmoidal?  Being way over the
T value shouldn't penalize us *too* much.  Being way under the sigmoidal shouldn't reward us
too much.

Reminder: for CFR-D the opponent has a choice of the T-value and playing to the subtree.
This is why we have no motivation to drive his value in the subtree below the T-value.

What is the gadget for maxmargin?

Can I think up a gadget that forces target player to achieve other goals or satisfy other
constraints?

Strong hands should achieve higher EV than weak hands.
No hand should achieve too much more than some baseline (the average CV?).

Try to satisfy twin goals:
1) The overall CV of the opponent is minimized;
2) The maximum value achieved by any opponent hand is minimized

Regular CFR achieves the first goal.  (Note: this assumes a specific reach range for the
opponent.)  Goal 2 can be maximized by a gadget, I guess.  Opponent has a choice of a
hand to play to the subgame.
